# ROI Project Planner AI

The **AI-powered ROI** Project Planner leverages machine learning to identify the most profitable projects within
capital constraints.

To support its AI capabilities, we use **TensorFlow**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **scikit-learn** for tasks like data
processing, model development, and performance optimization. Specifically, we train a TensorFlow model to optimize
project selection, enhancing decision-making based on historical data and financial constraints.

The purpose of the project is to showcase a broad range of skills, including expertise in advanced data structures, algorithms, SOLID principles, software engineering best practices, and AI/ML integration using Python. To help achieve our objectives, the problem statement is adapted from the [LeetCode IPO problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/ipo), with advanced modifications tailored to meet our specific requirements.

## How to Set Up and Run Locally

### Prerequisites

- [ROI Project Planner (Backend)](https://github.com/ranzyblessings/roi-project-planner) - Must be installed and running.
  locally.
- [Python v3.12.7](https://www.python.org/) (or the latest version).
- [Poetry v1.8.3](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) (or the latest version).

### Installation

Set up the project by installing its dependencies, including TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and others, using
Poetry.

```bash
poetry install
```

**Running the Project**

Run the project to analyze and prioritize projects based on ROI within specified constraints.

```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --maxProjects 5 --initialCapital 200
```

- `--maxProjects`: Limits the number of projects to select (e.g., 5).
- `--initialCapital`: Sets the initial capital budget (e.g., $200).

The script employs a trained machine learning model to optimize project selection, drawing on historical data and
financial constraints.

By default, it generates 10 random projects, integrating with the **ROI Project Planner (Backend)** to help the AI learn from a large dataset and refine its performance under varying conditions.

This feature can be disabled in `main.py` if you prefer to create and test based on your preferred projects, as outlined in the **API Usage guide** in the ROI Project Planner (Backend).

**Running Tests**

Validate the projectâ€™s functionality by running the test suite.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. poetry run pytest
```
